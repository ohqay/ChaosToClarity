## Chaos to Clarity Obsidian Theme

Welcome! This is a showcase of my iA Writer-inspired Obsidian theme, using the community theme "Minimal", select fonts, and a handful of plugins tailored to improve focus and create a calming aesthetic.

Clone the vault, and open the folder as a vault in Obsidian. Play around with it, and feel free to move your existing vault inside of it to make it your own!
